<h1>Avalanches</h1>
<p> This project would analyze avalanche statistics, searching for patterns and trends that would help people learn about avalanche safety and avoidance. This is becoming more relevant in the ski industry now because backcountry ski equipment is cheaper and more available now than ever before. Which means more people are skiing in the backcountry and are putting themselves at risk for getting caught in an avalanche.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.avalanche.org/">Avalanche.org</a>tracks every single avalanche in the country that has injured or killed a person. There is information about where the avalanche occured, who was involved, number of injuries and/or fatalities, and it links to the actual avalanche report filed by the local agency. My concern is that the information is compiled in a case-by-case scenario, and I don't know if it's something that I can pull a data file out of.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.powdermag.com/avalanche-education/centers/">Powder Magazine's The Safe Zone</a>. I currently work for Powder, managing their website. This is a project of ours that we hope to keep updated to educate our readers about avalanche safety and awareness. So I'm hoping this project could be something I could publish there. This map links to every single avalanche forecasting center in the United States, each of which would have people I could talk to about this.</p>
	<ul><h3>Things I'd need to learn:<h3>
		<p><li>Where do most avalanches happen? There are different kinds of snowpacks, depending on the region's weather patterns. They say that the continental snowpack—Colorado and the Rockies—is the most unstable. But does that translate to more skier-triggered incidents?</li>
		<li>How big are the groups in skier triggered avalanches? In a snow safety class, they recommend that you travel in groups of three. The bigger the group, the more your decision making is influenced, and that impacts your chances of getting caught in an avalanche. Do the numbers show that?</li>
		<li>Are avalanche fatalities going up as more people are going into the backcountry? The common thought is yes, but actually, last year saw a relatively low number of avalanche-related deaths. And the rate has stayed pretty constant. So I'd like to show that, too. And explore why.</li>
